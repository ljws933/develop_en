### What is inline code?
- It is a way to define a function or class within its calling code instead of being compiled into a separate function or class.
- Inline classes are mainly used when creating a Wrapping Class.
- Using inline classes loses its meaning if boxing occurs frequently.

## **What is an inline code?**

It is a way to define a function or class within its calling code instead of being compiled into a separate function or class.

**Comparison of code when inline and not inline**

- Defining a function without using inline and then calling it

``` kotlin
fun fn(n1: Int, n2: Int): Int {
    return n1 + n2
}

fun main() {
    val result = fn(1, 2)
    println(result)
}

```

- Compilation Result

``` kotlin
// A separate function is created just like what was defined in Kotlinpublic static final int fn(int n1, int n2) {
   return n1 + n2;
}

public static final void main() {
   int result = fn(1, 2);
   boolean var1 = false;
   System.out.println(result);
}

```

- Calling a function defined as inline

``` kotlin
inline fun fn(n1: Int, n2: Int): Int {
    return n1 + n2
}

fun main() {
    val result = fn(1, 2)
    println(result)
}

```

- Compilation Result

``` kotlin
public static final int fn(int n1, int n2) {
   int $i$f$fn = 0;
   return n1 + n2;
}

// The defined function is executed within mainpublic static final void main() {
   byte n1$iv = 1;
   int n2$iv = 2;
   int $i$f$fn = false;
   int result = n1$iv + n2$iv;
   boolean var4 = false;
   System.out.println(result);
}

```

As such, inline code puts the defined class/function into where it is called, which leads to great performance improvement when receiving functional arguments.

**Notes and Tips**

- Using inline functions will make the compiled code longer.
- It is more effective when the target function is relatively small.
- A significant portion of the higher-order functions provided by the Kotlin standard library are inline functions.
- The following higher-order function is effective when applied:

``` kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println(indexOf(intArrayOf(4, 3, 2, 1)){ it< 3})// 2// The compiled look of the inline indexOf() function is the followingval number =intArrayOf(4,3,2,1)
    var index = -1

    for (i in number.indices){
        if (number[i] < 3){
            index = i
            break
        }
    }
    println(index)// 2
}

inline fun indexOf(numbers: IntArray, condition: (Int) -> Boolean): Int {
    for (i in numbers.indices) {
        if (condition(numbers[i])) return i
    }
    return -1
}

```

**However, inline functions come with limitations:**

- Cannot receive arguments that can be null.
- Cannot receive private arguments.
- Cannot be used when encapsulation is necessary, as the function will be placed within the class.

## **Why is inline class necessary?**

Inline classes are mainly used when creating a Wrapping Class.

Suppose you want to convert a basic type such as UnixMillis, which is essentially a Long, into java.util.Calendar, or perform conversions for date and time.

**The first way is to create a general Wrapper Class:**

``` kotlin
class UnixMillis(private val millis: Long) {
// Convert the received mills data to Calendarfun toCalendar(): Calendar {
        return Calendar.getInstance().also {
            it.timeInMillis = millis
        }
    }
}

```

If you decompile this, you can get the following Java code:

``` kotlin
public static final void main() {
// Create a UnixMillis object
   UnixMillis unix = new UnixMillis(System.currentTimeMillis());
// Perform Calendar conversion using the object
   Calendar calendar = unix.toCalendar();
// This is not an optimized method as it creates a Calendar object every time
}

```

This way, every time you use the toCalendar() function, you have to create an object, which is burdensome.

### **Now, let's try to create it using an inline class**

``` kotlin
// Just add inline in front of the class and that's it.inline class UnixMillis(private val millis: Long) {
    fun toCalendar(): Calendar {
        return Calendar.getInstance().also {
            it.timeInMillis = millis
        }
    }
}

```

When you decompile this into Java code, you get the following:

``` kotlin
public static final void main() {
// Create a Long object instead of a UnixMillis object
   long unix = UnixMillis.constructor-impl(System.currentTimeMillis());

// Use the code inside the function being called (optimized only)
   Calendar calendar = UnixMillis.toCalendar-impl(unix);
}

```

By using an inline class, **you can see that the object is not created every time.**

**Note**

1. Inline classes must have only **one argument in the primary constructor**, which must be declared with var or val.
2. Inline classes cannot have an init.
3. Inline classes cannot have backing field (e.g. lateinit, delegated, etc.).
4. Starting from Kotlin 1.5, you can also use value classes.
5. For JVM backend, you must add @JvmInline.

## Why you shouldn't use inline classes recklessly

As mentioned earlier, inline classes are mainly used when creating a Wrapping Class.

When you use a Wrapping Class, it **boxes and unboxes** the internal value every time it is used.

If you look at the following inline class example:

``` kotlin
inline class Password(val value: String)

```

- Boxing means storing value as a Password object.
- Unboxing means getting the value from Password.

That is, **if boxing occurs frequently, using an inline class loses its meaning.**

**Example of boxing multiple times**

``` kotlin
interface Iinline class Foo(val i: Int) : I
fun asInline(f: Foo) {}
fun <T> asGeneric(x: T) {}
fun asInterface(i: I) {}
fun asNullable(i: Foo?) {}
// The id function just returns the received value as it isfun <T> id(x: T): T = x

fun main() {
    val f = Foo(42)

// unboxed: Since f is an object of Foo, you can use it as is// Therefore, there is no need to box/unbox again when using f
    asInline(f)

// Basically, when you don't receive an inline class object as a function argument// You have to box it once and then unbox it again// boxed: Since the Foo object is received as a generic type T, boxing is necessary// Therefore, you have to box it once and then unbox it again to use f
    asGeneric(f)

// boxed: An inline class object must be converted to the corresponding interface// Therefore, you have to box it once to use f
    asInterface(f)

// boxed: When there is a nullable inline class object, boxing is necessary// Therefore, you have to box it once and then unbox it again to use f
    asNullable(f)

// unboxed: Since no boxing is necessary, you can use it as is// Therefore, you don't have to box/unbox again when using f
    val x = id(f)
}

```
